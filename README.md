## Team Preferences 
  The team’s expectations for what will be accomplished this semester are: work efficiently, understand the tools introduced in the course, help each other with any questions or tasks, and have fun. The goals of the team for this semester are to be individually dependable, evenly divide responsibility and maintain an understanding and dialog concerning the process and project, and reach out and accept help when needed. Obstacles that the team might encounter while attempting to reach their goals could be time management, communicating effectively as a team while remote, reaching out for help, and quickly learning new technologies. The team’s position on how to handle some people wanting an “A” while others think a “B” is acceptable is to talk with each other and aim for achieving an “A”. However, the team will be realistic with their goals of achieving an “A” when time limits are concerned. 
  
  The team also believes that it is not acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”. The team will strive to balance the workload and rely on each other. The team will work on the project one to two hours a day in order to make the project successful. However, more time may be required in order to accomplish more difficult tasks. The tasks will be assigned according to the strengths and weaknesses of each team member initially, but there will be some flexibility there with roles evolving over time. If a team member does not follow through on a commitment, such as missing a deadline or not showing up for a meeting, the team will communicate with that individual in order to straighten things out or get on the same page. If this happens more than once or twice, the team will bring in a TA and/or Dave to figure out the issue.
  
  Communication has been identified as being crucial in our successes which is included in sharing a standard for the quality of work accepting criticisms, being lenient to each other, and being able to reach compromises or conclusions on where our quality of work is capable of being. The team has decided to hold standing meetings each week, as needed, outside of class and allowing the frequency to change as the project progresses. The team acknowledges that individual work habits will differ, but only if the project remains on task. If individual work habits start to affect the team project in a negative way then we shall be engaging in conversation in order to quickly and efficiently resolve the problem.
  
  An important goal for this team is to keep everyone on the same page with technical and design decisions. When there is a major decision to make, all members will come together to create a plan that works for everyone. Even for small changes, at least one other member will be consulted with to ensure the right course of action. If a conflict in opinion arises, a compromise will be decided on to work out a solution. The same reasoning applies for the workload of members. No one person should dominate the workload, and if they do, the group will come together to help even the workload between members. All of these principles help ensure efficient and effective progress while minimizing internal conflict.
